#Chunking for LLM modelling

The objective of this project is to develop a system that efficiently processes and analyzes textual content from PDF documents. It involves extracting text from the PDF, splitting it into sections based on specific patterns or content, and organizing these sections into a doubly linked list for easy traversal. Each section is further processed to generate semantic embeddings using a transformer-based model, capturing its meaning in a numerical vector form. These embeddings are then indexed into Qdrant, a vector database designed for semantic search, enabling efficient similarity-based retrieval. Finally, the system allows users to query the indexed data to retrieve relevant sections based on semantic similarity to the input query.
